Benchmarking Tools
==================

This repository contains a collection of tools for benchmarking the performance
of multi-agent and single-agent algorithms.

To run the benchmarking tools, you can run:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd safepo/single_agent
    python benchmark.py

with the default configuration. This will run the benchmarking tools then reproduce the
figures in the paper. You can also run the multi-agent benchmarking tools by running:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd safepo/multi_agent
    python benchmark.py

After running the benchmarking tools, you can run the `plooting tools and evaluation tools <./eval.html>`_  to
show the results.
